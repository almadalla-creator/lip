<div class="chapter-subtitle">Before I Knew What I Was Protecting</div>
<p>I graduated in International Marketing with the kind of confidence that only theory gives you.</p>
<p>Later I added Digital Marketing because it felt like the future. Data, automation, funnels, positioning. I believed systems could be improved. I believed companies were inefficient only because no one had thought clearly enough.</p>
<p>At twenty-four, I was convinced that clarity was rare and that I had it.</p>
<p>My first job was at a small FMCG company. Nothing glamorous. Local distribution, tight margins, old habits. I came in full of frameworks. Market segmentation. Brand repositioning. Consumer journey mapping.</p>
<p>I saw gaps everywhere.</p>
<p>I prepared presentations no one asked for.</p>
<p>I stayed late building strategies that would “modernize” the company.</p>
<p>The first time I presented my ideas, I thought they would feel relieved. Finally, someone thinking properly.</p>
<p>Instead, I felt resistance.</p>
<p>Not direct rejection. Worse. Polite dismissal.</p>
<p>“That’s not how we do it here.”</p>
<p>I tried again. Adjusted the tone. Added more data. Made it more practical.</p>
<p>Same response.</p>
<p>The system was already approved. Already stable. Already defended.</p>
<p>I began to understand something I hadn’t considered at university.</p>
<p>Ideas don’t win. Position does.</p>
<p>Around that time I started a relationship with Laura. She was a project manager in a fit-out company. Confident. Decisive. Financially stable. Already respected in her field.</p>
<p>She didn’t need to prove she was capable. She already was.</p>
<p>At first, I admired that.</p>
<p>Later, I compared myself to it.</p>
<p>She would talk about site deadlines, contractor negotiations, client escalations. Real pressure. Real authority.</p>
<p>I talked about presentations that didn’t get approved.</p>
<p>I started measuring myself against her progress.</p>
<p>She never asked me to. I did it on my own.</p>
<p>Small friction started appearing in places that had nothing to do with work.</p>
<p>She would say, “You overthink things.”</p>
<p>I would say, “You move too fast.”</p>
<p>We were both right. And both defending something.</p>
<p>After two years at the FMCG company, I left.</p>
<p>Not dramatically. Not angrily. Just convinced that I needed a bigger stage.</p>
<p>I joined a real estate development company. Larger budgets. Larger visibility. Larger risk.</p>
<p>This time I didn’t start by changing things.</p>
<p>I observed.</p>
<p>I followed the system carefully. Understood how decisions were made. Who influenced what. Where the silent approvals lived.</p>
<p>I wasn’t trying to improve it immediately. I was trying to decode it.</p>
<p>When I finally presented my market approach plan, it wasn’t theoretical. It was aligned. It fit their internal logic but improved efficiency.</p>
<p>The CEO approved it.</p>
<p>For the first time in my career, an idea wasn’t dismissed.</p>
<p>It was adopted.</p>
<p>The first campaign launched successfully. Sales traction exceeded projections.</p>
<p>I felt something settle inside me.</p>
<p>Not pride.</p>
<p>Validation.</p>
<p>People started asking for my input earlier in meetings. My emails were answered faster. My tone carried weight.</p>
<p>Respect feels subtle when it grows.</p>
<p>You notice it in how long people hold eye contact.</p>
<p>I began speaking with more certainty.</p>
<p>Then more authority.</p>
<p>Then more control.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I stopped collaborating and started directing.</p>
<p>I told myself it was leadership.</p>
<p>The team around me started responding differently.</p>
<p>Not openly resistant. Just slower. Less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>I noticed it.</p>
<p>And instead of adjusting, I tightened my grip.</p>
<p>I believed clarity required firmness.</p>
<p>I did not realize firmness was becoming rigidity.</p>
<p>I was finally inside the system I once tried to change.</p>
<p>And I was beginning to defend it.</p>
<p>I did not notice when confidence became tone.</p>
<p>It happened gradually.</p>
<p>When campaigns succeeded, I felt justified. When projections matched reality, I felt precise. When meetings moved in the direction I suggested, I felt necessary.</p>
<p>Being necessary is addictive.</p>
<p>Laura noticed the shift before I did.</p>
<p>“You talk to me like you’re presenting,” she said once.</p>
<p>I laughed. I thought she was exaggerating.</p>
<p>I wasn’t.</p>
<p>At work, I had learned to structure everything. Problem. Cause. Solution. Next step. I brought that home without realizing it.</p>
<p>If she expressed frustration, I explained it.
If she expressed doubt, I reframed it.
If she expressed emotion, I reduced it to logic.</p>
<p>I thought I was stabilizing the situation.</p>
<p>She felt unheard.</p>
<p>Her family added another layer.</p>
<p>They were religious. Practicing. Structured. Clear about what was right and wrong.</p>
<p>I wasn’t.</p>
<p>I didn’t reject religion aggressively. I simply didn’t carry it. It wasn’t part of how I built decisions. I trusted analysis more than belief.</p>
<p>At dinners, her father would speak about faith as guidance.</p>
<p>I would stay silent.</p>
<p>Not out of respect.</p>
<p>Out of calculation.</p>
<p>Arguing would create unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>Silence was easier.</p>
<p>Laura sat in the middle. She believed, but not rigidly. She carried religion as background structure. I carried structure as system.</p>
<p>We rarely argued about faith directly.</p>
<p>The friction appeared elsewhere.</p>
<p>She would say, “You think everything can be optimized.”</p>
<p>I would say, “Most things can.”</p>
<p>What I didn’t say was that optimization gave me control.</p>
<p>Control gave me safety.</p>
<p>At work, that safety was reinforced.</p>
<p>After the successful market plan, the CEO started involving me earlier in strategy meetings. I felt trusted.</p>
<p>When junior team members hesitated, I filled the space. When they proposed ideas that didn’t align, I corrected them quickly.</p>
<p>Efficiency increased.</p>
<p>Warmth decreased.</p>
<p>I didn’t notice that either.</p>
<p>Then one quarter underperformed.</p>
<p>Nothing dramatic. Just below forecast.</p>
<p>For the first time since joining, I had to explain numbers instead of presenting growth.</p>
<p>I prepared the explanation carefully.</p>
<p>External conditions.
Timing shifts.
Lead conversion variance.</p>
<p>All true.</p>
<p>All incomplete.</p>
<p>I did not include the part where I had ignored internal hesitation because I was confident in my projection.</p>
<p>The CEO listened. Nodded. Accepted the explanation.</p>
<p>I felt relief.</p>
<p>Relief is dangerous.</p>
<p>It teaches you that reframing works.</p>
<p>That same week, Laura told me I had become distant.</p>
<p>“You’re here,” she said, “but you’re not really here.”</p>
<p>I almost answered the way I do in meetings.</p>
<p>Clarify. Structure. Solve.</p>
<p>Instead, I asked, “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>“That’s what I mean,” she said.</p>
<p>Laura did not argue often.</p>
<p>When she did, it was usually short.</p>
<p>“You’re not listening,” she would say.</p>
<p>“I am,” I would answer.</p>
<p>And technically, I was.</p>
<p>I heard the words. I processed the content. I responded to the structure.</p>
<p>What I didn’t do was sit inside the emotion long enough for it to remain uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Discomfort feels inefficient.</p>
<p>At work, inefficiency costs money. At home, I treated it the same way.</p>
<p>Around that time, her family started asking about the wedding.</p>
<p>Not the date. The format.</p>
<p>Church ceremony. Religious blessing. Traditional structure.</p>
<p>Laura wasn’t rigid about it, but she wasn’t neutral either.</p>
<p>“It matters to them,” she said.</p>
<p>“It matters to you,” I replied.</p>
<p>She hesitated before answering.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>I could have asked more.</p>
<p>Instead, I started listing logistics.</p>
<p>Venue size.
Guest distribution.
Budget allocation.</p>
<p>Structure felt safer than belief.</p>
<p>Her father invited us to dinner the following Sunday. After the meal, he spoke about commitment.</p>
<p>“Marriage is not only between two people,” he said. “It’s before God.”</p>
<p>I stayed quiet.</p>
<p>Not because I was unsure.</p>
<p>Because I calculated the cost of speaking.</p>
<p>If I argue, tension increases.
If I stay silent, stability remains.</p>
<p>Silence won.</p>
<p>Laura noticed.</p>
<p>“You don’t say what you think,” she said in the car afterward.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the benefit,” I answered.</p>
<p>The conversation ended there.</p>
<p>At work, momentum continued.</p>
<p>The real estate company was expanding. New projects. Larger visibility. Marketing campaigns grew more aggressive.</p>
<p>The CEO valued speed.</p>
<p>I valued positioning.</p>
<p>We overlapped enough to function well.</p>
<p>Until we didn’t.</p>
<p>The new development project was ambitious. High-end, high exposure. The kind of launch that could redefine the company’s brand perception.</p>
<p>Approvals were still pending. Floor plans not fully locked. Design flexibility still open.</p>
<p>The CEO wanted to start selling off-plan immediately.</p>
<p>“Velocity,” he said in the executive meeting. “We create urgency now.”</p>
<p>I knew what early sales meant.</p>
<p>Marketing carries the promise.
If design shifts later, marketing absorbs the dissatisfaction.
If delivery delays, marketing absorbs the frustration.</p>
<p>Boldness is visible.
Corrections are invisible.
Blame is rarely invisible.</p>
<p>I spoke carefully.</p>
<p>“We can create anticipation without committing to early contracts,” I said. “If we wait until construction reaches twenty-five percent, credibility increases. It protects long-term trust.”</p>
<p>He didn’t reject the idea aggressively.</p>
<p>He dismissed it lightly.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait for perfect conditions,” he said. “Marketing creates demand. Risk is part of growth.”</p>
<p>There were nods around the table.</p>
<p>Not strong ones.</p>
<p>But enough.</p>
<p>I felt something tighten.</p>
<p>Not anger.</p>
<p>Reduction.</p>
<p>When authority shifts, it is rarely loud. It narrows.</p>
<p>The meeting ended.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, an internal email adjusted reporting structure. Campaign sequencing would align directly under CEO approval. Budget oversight to be reviewed.</p>
<p>My title stayed the same.</p>
<p>My control did not.</p>
<p>I read the email twice.</p>
<p>It was clean. Administrative. Polite.</p>
<p>I leaned back in my chair.</p>
<p>If this stands, it becomes the truth.</p>
<p>Not about the project.</p>
<p>About me.</p>
