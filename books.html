      The primers help you recognize patterns fast.
      These books take you deeper,slowly,clearly,without motivational noise.

    <p class="breakline">
      No more justification.
      No more performing a version of yourself to keep life stable.
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      If you’ve ever said “I’m just tired” when you were actually avoiding a decision,
      you already know what this is about.

      <h2>Beyond the Social Mask</h2>

      <p>
        This is not a book about growth.
        It is a dissection.
      </p>

      <p>
        It removes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The story you tell about your identity</li>
        <li>The comfort of belonging</li>
        <li>The illusion that performance is authenticity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It shows how adaptation becomes self.
        And why collapse is not an accident.

        Not a memoir.
        Not confession.
        Not redemption.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is structural introspection.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How identity formed</li>
        <li>How fear shaped decisions</li>
        <li>How compensation became character</li>
