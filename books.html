      <p class="lead">
        The primers help you recognize patterns fast.
        These books take you deeper,slowly,clearly,without motivational noise.
      </p>
      <p class="breakline">
        No more justification.
        No more performing a version of yourself to keep life stable.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        If you’ve ever said “I’m just tired” when you were actually avoiding a decision,
        you already know what this is about.

        <p>
          A structural autobiography.
          Not confession,not redemption.
          An attempt to understand how a life becomes a person.

        No rituals.
        No promises.
